# Customer-Satisfaction-Analysis

## Project Overview

This project report gives a detailed analysis of customer satisfaction using rating, with the aim to analysze patterns and give recommendation on how to improve customer retention and satisfy customers using multiple customer segments from the data set. 

## Dataset Overview

The data set had a record of 120 customers with average rating 5.35, and rating range from 1-10. There was no duplicate or errors found the data set. I created a new column using power query for the breakdown of customers ages into age brackets to get satisfaction across life stages. I did my Analysis and visualization using Powerbi.

## Analysis Breakdown

### Overview Analysis

A. Support Contact Impact
- Contacted Support (Yes): Avg. Score = 5.36
- Did Not Contact Support (No): Avg. Score = 5.34
Insight: Minimal difference in satisfaction, indicating support contact has a neutral impact. However, this suggests support quality is consistent.

B. Age Group 
- Highest Satisfaction: Age 46–60 (5.60)
- Lowest Satisfaction: Age 36–45 (4.84)
Insight: Older customers report slightly higher satisfaction, suggesting product/services resonate more with mature users.

C. Gender Distribution
- Female: 55%
- Male: 45%
Insight: The customer base is slightly more female-oriented.

D. Purchase History
- Yes (57.5%) vs No (42.5%)
Insight: Majority of customers have made purchases before, suggesting recurring users dominate.

E. Satisfaction by Loyalty Level
- High Loyalty: 5.65
- Low Loyalty: 5.84
- Medium Loyalty: 4.47
Insight: Surprisingly, low loyalty users rated higher than medium loyalty, indicating possible dissatisfaction buildup in medium group.

F. Satisfaction by Factor
Top Factors:
- Product Quality (7.55)
- Packaging (7.00)
- Product Variety (6.10)

Lowest Factors:
- Ease of Use (4.07)
- Features (4.08)
- Price (4.40)

### Regional Analysis

A. Top Regions by Satisfaction
- Chicago, IL: 6.36
- Austin, TX: 6.25
- New York, NY: 6.00
Lowest: San Antonio, TX (3.50)

B. Customer Distribution by Location
Top Contributors:
- Phoenix, AZ (19 customers)
- Chicago, IL / Houston, TX (14 each)
Least: San Antonio, TX (6 customers)
Insight: High-volume cities aren't always the most satisfied; e.g., Phoenix has most users but mid-level satisfaction.

C. Satisfaction by Region and Loyalty
Insight: San Antonio customers are least satisfied regardless of loyalty level—indicates a critical area for review.

## Key Insight

- Product Quality and Packaging are the strongest satisfaction drivers.
- Medium-loyalty customers show lower satisfaction—possible growing disengagement.
- Features, pricing, and usability are weak points across customer feedback.
- Regional satisfaction varies widely; San Antonio and Dallas need urgent service or engagement improvement.
- Gender and support interactions have minimal influence on satisfaction scores.

## Recommendations

1. Feature and Usability Improvement
- Invest in UX research to enhance ease of use and feature relevance.
- Survey medium-loyalty users to identify pain points before churn.

2. Location-Based Engagement
- Conduct root-cause analysis in San Antonio and Dallas.
- Pilot localized improvements in these cities (e.g., faster delivery, better support).

3. Customer Retention Strategy
- Target medium-loyalty customers with special offers or personalized communication.
- Encourage product feedback loops to keep these users engaged.

4. Marketing Emphasis
- Highlight strong product quality and packaging in campaigns.
- Address feature and price concerns transparently in promotional messaging.

5. Age-Based Segmentation
- Consider tailored offerings for younger segments (age 20–35) where satisfaction is slightly lower.
